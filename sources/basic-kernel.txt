# All options are required unless noted as "Optional" or under a # Begin and # End block, which is also noted as "Optional" or "Hardware Specific"
# It is important that they are selected as built-in or the kernel might fail to correctly detect the partitions and/or filesystems.
# It is a good idea to run "make defconfig" first

   # End here

   <*> Serial ATA and Parallel ATA drivers  --->
      [*]   ATA ACPI Support

   # Use lspci -k and look for "SATA or ATA controller" and its driver. Then select apropriate
   # device down below.
   #
   # On my machine I have:
   #
   # 00:1f.2 SATA controller: Intel Corporation 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family 6 port SATA AHCI Controller (rev 05)
   #    Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company Device 1670
   #    Kernel driver in use: ahci
   #
   # So I select the first two drivers below.

   # Begin hardware dependent (S)ATA controller configuration

      <*>   AHCI SATA support
      <*>   Platform AHCI SATA support (both for the "ahci" driver)

      [*]   ATA SFF support (for legacy IDE and PATA)
      [*]     ATA BMDMA support (both required for drivers below)

      <*>       Intel ESB, ICH, PIIX3, PIIX4 PATA/SATA support ("ata_piix" driver, also used in VMware virtual machines)
      <*>       Marvell SATA support ("sata_marvel" driver)
      <*>       NVIDIA SATA support ("sata_nvidia" driver)
      <*>       SiS 964/965/966/180 SATA support ("sata_sis" driver)
      <*>       VIA SATA support ("sata_via" driver)
      <*>     Generic ATA support ("ata_generic" driver, select it anyways if the machine has non-AHCI (S)ATA controller)

      # Additionally, select any driver that's apropriate for your hardware and not on this list. The list contains the
      # most commonly used desktop hardware nowadays.

   # End hardware dependent (S)ATA controller configuration

   # Optional, required for VMware virtual machines
   # Begin here
   [*] Fusion MPT device support  --->
      <*>   Fusion MPT ScsiHost drivers for SPI (used by VMware Player and Workstation by default)
   # End here

   # Optional, required for booting from USB devices
   # Begin USB configuration

   [*] USB support  --->
      <*>   Support for Host-side USB
      <*>     USB Monitor

      # One or more of the USB controller drivers, hardware dependent. You can look in the "lsmod"
      # output of your distro to figure out which one is loaded.

      # Begin hardware specific part

      <*>     xHCI HCD (USB 3.0) support ("xhci_hcd" driver)
      <*>     EHCI HCD (USB 2.0) support ("ehci_hcd" driver)
      <*>     OHCI HCD (USB 1.1) support ("ohci_hcd" driver)
      <*>     UHCI HCD (most Intel and VIA) support ("uhci_hcd" driver)

      # End hardware specific part

      <*>     USB Mass Storage support

   # End USB configuration

File systems  --->

   # WARNING: It is important that you select the filesystem for your root and (optionally) /boot partition as "builtin",
   # while the others can also be selected as "module"

   <*> Second extended fs support (ext2)
      [*]   Ext2 extended attributes
      [*]     Ext2 POSIX Access Control Lists
      [*]     Ext2 Security Labels
      [*]   Ext2 execute in place support

   <*> Ext3 journalling file system support (ext3)
      [*]   Default to 'data=ordered' in ext3
      [*]   Ext3 extended attributes
      [*]     Ext3 POSIX Access Control Lists
      [*]     Ext3 Security Labels

   <*> The Extended 4 (ext4) filesystem (ext4)
      [*]   Ext4 POSIX Access Control Lists
      [*]   Ext4 Security Labels

   <*> JFS filesystem support (jfs)
      [*]   JFS POSIX Access Control Lists
      [*]   JFS Security Labels

      [*]   XFS Realtime subvolume support

   <*> Btrfs filesystem support (btrfs)
      [*]   Btrfs POSIX Access Control Lists

   # Additionally, any other filesystem not listed here.

   # NOTE: Basic LFS install only contains filesystem check tools for ext{2,3,4} filesystems.
   # It is a good idea to install the tools specific to other filesystems before first boot
   # to avoid warnings and/or failures at boot.
